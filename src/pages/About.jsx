          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
            Marvel Meals isn’t just your regular recipe hub — it’s a tribute to the superheroes we grew up admiring.
            Each seafood dish we feature has a spark of inspiration from characters who’ve saved the world more times
            than we can count. Whether you’re channeling your inner Thor with a mighty shrimp bowl or craving a
            Captain Marvel-worthy spice kick, we’ve got something that’ll hit the spot.
